Simply place poems in the "poems" folder and entries in the "journal" folder and Objektiv will take care of the rest. # Write a few cool sentences about yourself here.

Objektiv is a Hugo theme for amateur poets. It also features a "Journal" section for blogging and general writing.

On this demo site, you'll see placeholder content for both poetry and journal entries. The "poems" section is specially designed for poetry, with special font, letter size and line height for the best poetry reading experience.

Hugo is a lightning-fast static site generator built with the programming language "Go". It takes simple markdown files and outputs a complete website in HTML documents. Themes like Objektiv take care of styles, templates and set-up so you can start writing **without touching a single line of code.**

If you're an aspiring poet and you want your website to look like this one, follow [these instructions]() to get your site up and running in a few clicks. There is no local development needed, installations, coding or hosting cost. All you need is a free GitHub account. 

All code is open source and 100% free to use, copy, modify and redistribute.
