Welcome! This is a custom theme built for a friend. However, if you find the theme suitable for your needs, feel free to follow the intructions below to use the theme for yourself! This theme is free and open-source.

## How to start using this theme

> [!NOTE]
> These instructions assume you intend to use GitHub Pages as your host and does *not* require any need for local development. Instead, it relies on GitHub Actions to automatically rebuild the site any time you modify the repository's content. Note that this is not exactly the usual for working with Hugo sites, where most authors use Git to push changes from their local machine.

> [!NOTE]
> These instructions are intended for anyone to follow, regardless of technical background. If you have any problems setting up, feel free to open an issue.

The first thing you'll need to make sure you have is a GitHub account. Click [here](https://github.com/signup) to create one of you haven't already. You can also use an existing Google or Apple account.

> [!TIP]
> Choose  meaningful username, since it will appear in your website's url. For example, if you choose `PolarBear` as your username, your website's url will `https://polarbear.github.io`. Consider using your name in some way, unless you have a username with an established digital identity.

Once you've created an account, it's time to create a repository.

> ###### For my friend:
> As a new GitHub user, I was always intimidated at the terms like "repository". Actually, there's nothing to be afraid of. A repository, or a "repo", is simply a place where all your code for one project lives. On your own computer, that usually looks like a folder with a bunch of subfolders and code files. And on GitHub, it's no different. When you open a new repo, it's like creating a new folder on your computer. Simple!

Instead of creating a new repository and copying code files to it one by one, we'll do something a lot more efficient: we'll just make a fork of an existing one.


> ###### For my friend:
> A "fork" can also be a confusing term for beginners. A fork is nothing more than a copy of the original repository. When we fork a repository, we're basically making a special personalized copy of it for ourselves. If you've ever used the "spin-off" feature on Khan Academy, this is the exact same thing, but on GitHub.

First, make sure you're logged in to GitHub. Now head over to the repository we want to fork. Here's the [link]().

Next, we'll click on "Import repository".

You'll be taken to a new page where we can now input the information of the repo we need to clone.
